# Selenium Test Suite
This is the Selenium tests application, it requires a WebDriver, Node.js v16+ and any version of Java to take advantage of the JVM.
To run the application, the node modules have to be created using command:
    
    npm install

This will create all the dependencies inside the project.

To run the tests simply execute the command:

    node testSuite.js

* Note that a WebDriver like "geckodriver" must be in the main directory of the Selenium tests application.
